This code displays a webpage of Geneva Switzerland (my hometown)

To open the webpage, open using google chrome.


It uses google map API to load the map of the Geneva area as well as place markers.

A search is performed using the foursquare API. The user can select different types of locations based on their need (ie. food, drinks, etc)

The javascript for this project is separated into multiple javascript files.
 - the knockout file is required to be able to use the view model
 - the app file is used for any application work
 - the gmaps file contains all the handshaking to the google API
 - the foursquare file contains all the handshaking to the foursquare API.
